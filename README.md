Hi, I'm Zen Sepiol, 

I'll talk about C++ and software development in general.

I love code and I love software. Especially the hidden part (backend) where all the magic happens. 
Stay if you are as interested in uncompromised performance and sustainable designs as I am. 

Most of you use systems I have designed or contributed to. 
Many years experience working as tech lead on huge code bases and industry leading companys in tech (and counting).

More and more people get into programming and the bars have come down to be successful. Unfortunately, over the years the number of professionals lacking understanding in basic concepts has grown equally. 
Not all software is web or scripts and at its core everything needs to be fast.
